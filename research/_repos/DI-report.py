"""ScoreCard assembly for the WP-7 scoring pipeline.

:func:`generate_report` takes the per-competency scores and the language report
and assembles the final :class:`ScoreCard`:

* ``overall_score`` is the mean of the competency scores, clamped to 0-5 (0.0
  when there are no competencies).
* ``weak_competencies`` is exactly the set of competencies whose band is
  ``weak`` or ``developing`` — the list the Prep Coach loop consumes to decide
  what to teach next. It is a subset of the scorecard's competencies.
* ``model_answers`` holds one improved answer per planned question.
* strengths / weaknesses / next_steps / summary are written by the LLM.
