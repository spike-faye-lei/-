"""Competency evaluation for the WP-7 scoring pipeline.

For every planned question we score the candidate's matching answer against the
question's rubric, producing one :class:`CompetencyScore`. Two things are pinned
deterministically rather than trusted to the model, because they carry the
loop contract:

* ``competency`` is forced to the question's ``target_competency`` (so the
  scorecard's competencies map back onto the plan and, downstream, onto the
  Prep Coach's shared entity space).
* ``level`` is derived from the numeric ``score`` via :func:`level_for_score`,
  so the band always agrees with the number.

When several questions share one ``target_competency`` their scores are merged
by averaging, and the merged band is re-derived from the averaged score.
