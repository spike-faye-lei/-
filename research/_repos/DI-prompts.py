"""Prompt builders for the WP-7 scoring pipeline.

English-first: every system prompt is in English. The post phase is
latency-tolerant, so prompts here can be richer than the live agent's. Each
builder returns a ``(system, user)`` tuple whose ``user`` payload is a compact,
model-readable summary of the relevant interview state (question + rubric +
candidate answer), keeping each call self-contained.

The mock LLM ignores prompt content entirely, so these strings only matter once
a real provider is wired; the deterministic offline behaviour comes from the
post modules overriding the structurally-significant fields themselves (e.g.
``competency`` and ``level`` in the evaluator).
